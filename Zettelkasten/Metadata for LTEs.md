# Metadata for LTEs

[[factors]] in the database: 
when adding factors in the database: : factor picked in an ontology of factors, so controlled vocab:
then do we need more that one value / unit pair? 
factor ID: link to the factor 
value, unit, do we need a comment? 
example of previous [crop]: that can be a factor (could be extracted from the design)
previous crop: name of crop, and yield? 
[grazing]: name of grazing stock, some value? or just YES/NO? 
crop farms, vegetable farms, grazing farms
factors in the soils would be something you put in, like  a fertiliser or something that you grow in, or graze on. 
also, what happen to land: event like weather even as a factor rather than a note. 
do we have an ontology of field treatments> or is it something to design? is it something I should know?
irrigation: yes/no, and frequency? 
irrigation as mimicking rainfall or as a factor - normal, standar for that area? then how do you compare? monitoring the same thing!!!!! 
mechanized, conventional? what mechanisation? the yields could depend on mechanisation of harvest? 

go to all the sites and see what they are doing and what would be optimal  what is in common?
Do we need Local network? global nework? some factors localised
