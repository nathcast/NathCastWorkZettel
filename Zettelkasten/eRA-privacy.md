From Rothamsted page: a nice long privacy statement
![[Pasted image 20240112182303.png]]
I have had a look at the site - as there is no more login, no more cookies are colleted. Session information is collected 

- [ ] read the privacy document from Rothamsted and ensure that it we are doing that
- [ ] review what information is collected in session: some variables are never used. 
- [ ] Delete session information from time to times! 
- [ ] Keep the functions in case we reinstate the magic links (but I doubt that this will happened! )
- [ ] Make a toast, click to acknowledge that we are collecting traffic info (google analytics and hide for 6 months)
