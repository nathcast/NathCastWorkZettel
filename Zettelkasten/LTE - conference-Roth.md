# LTE - conference-Roth

in this place, I am not able to make comments on the science. Let see what comes out! 


### Soil [[organic]]
carbon and nitrogen dynamics under long-term conservation agriculture systems in Cambodia 
VIRA LENG (Cambodian Conservation Agriculture Research for Development Center, Cambodia)

### Soil organic matter stocks decrease despite increasing plant productivity - Insights from 14C analyses of an 80-years-old field experiment 
SABINA BRAUN (Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Sweden)

### workshop - global challenges for LTEs
What is it all about?
thinking of harmonised ways to do business

### Group1 ; hypothesis and factors for LTE in the south


what [factors] for experiment design? which ones to include in southern experiments to compare with the world? 
what hypothesis will increase SOM? compared with what is happening now? 
soil health benefits - 
[ontology]
four factors - need to be comparable with other LTEs. 
animals, without animals?  
[grazing] as a trial, 
fixating nitrogen in the soil: so previous crop is there. NFixation as a factor. 
livestock: how to include a livestock level? 
with or without livestock - recycled? 
livestock performance. 
In some part of the world: no livestock - 
rotation- 
soil type 
levels of rotations type of rotation 
alternating
how to include [livestock] as a factor for the experiment? presence or not: I have the feeling that it is not enough  - what do I know? 
Number of crops per year? that is also a variable in the design of the experiment. [experiment design]
small scale farmers
also a system that includes that produces enough [nutriment] instead of relying on imports. So growth for nutrition rather than [calories]
[agroforestry]? 
reportI is globalisation needed?

group4: human nutrition security and soil health security - principle for a new LTE: not too complited, but agile, can adapt - include farmers, growers, sharing ideas they have. small scale farmers are risk adverse. 
recycling nutrients, from urban areas? can we use urban waste? building in resilience. increase biodiversity New options for robotics. 

group 2: 
sustainable production towards global change
types of crops: old v new, 
farming systems:
cropping system - mono, inter, rotation
texture of the soil - natural acidity
potential flooding of soils. 
climate. 
crops using organic amendments of not PRocessed or not> 
soil management

Group 1: 
[sustainability] through adoption - need for partipation - need to consult farmers 
factors: cropping systems. 

[andy neal]: : LTE are essential. [Plots] intentionally degraded. 5 years is usually the length of funding, And in 5 years, show no change. even at 10 years... at 54 years: shows distinct differences. LTEs stop wasting money on systems that do not with to show consequences of [treatments].
