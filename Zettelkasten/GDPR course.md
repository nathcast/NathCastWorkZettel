data processor, data controller
spirit of the regulation 
7 principles: 
-  lawfulness, fairness, transparency : 
	- lawfulness: is it lawful for that organisation to collect data? I have a valid reason for processing that data - from a list of 6. 
	- ![[Pasted image 20231115183204.png]]
	- Fairness: using in ways they reasonably expect 
	- transparency: being clear and honest about who we are, where data is, what we do and what right: all this information must be written in a privacy policy. Privacy notice must be clear: A **Privacy Policy** (**PP**) is different from a **Data Protection Policy** (**DPP**).

A **DPP** is internal to an organisation and broadly outlines how the management and staff will help achieve and maintain compliance with data protection laws.

A **PP** on the other hand is external and is designed to ensure that your organisation's processing is transparent. It should explain who your organisation is, what data you collect, why you collect, how you use it, who has access to it, how long you'll keep it for, and what rights they have as data subjects.

There's also another document, often called a **Privacy Notice** or **Privacy Statement** (though it _could_ be called anything). This is a condensed version of the full **PP** and is designed to very quickly give a broad outline of the full document and provide a link so that people can read more if they want to.

If someone is entering their details through a website and they come to a field which asks for personal data, a **Privacy Notice** may pop up giving them the important details rather than having to read through a full **PP**.
