# CRISPR gene editing
**From:  https://www.nature.com/articles/520593a  - Embryo editing sparks epic debate** 
The team used CRISPR/Cas9 to modify a gene that can cause a potentially fatal blood disorder called β-thalassaemia when it is mutated. Some researchers have suggested that such a procedure, if done in a viable embryo, could eradicate devastating genetic diseases before a baby is born. Others say **that such work crosses an ethical line:** in response to the rumours that the work was being carried out, researchers warned in _Nature_[2](https://www.nature.com/articles/520593a#ref-CR2 "Lanphier, E. et al. Nature 519, 410–411 (2015).") and _Science_[3](https://www.nature.com/articles/520593a#ref-CR3 "Baltimore, D. et al. Science 348, 36–38 (2015).") in March that because the genetic changes to embryos — a procedure known as **germline modification** — are heritable, they could have an unpredictable effect on future generations.

### The Mutant Project: Inside the Global Race to Genetically Modify Humans

[Eben Kirksey](https://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=dp_byline_sr_audible_1?ie=UTF8&search-alias=audible&field-keywords=Eben+Kirksey) (Author), https://amzn.eu/d/eMVLffX  https://eben-kirksey.space/ 
An anthropologist visits the frontiers of the next scientific revolution to ask: Whose values are guiding gene editing experiments, and what are the implications for humanity? 

At a conference in Hong Kong in November 2018, Dr. He Jiankui announced that he had created the first genetically modified babies - twin girls named Lulu and Nana - sending shockwaves around the world. A year later, a Chinese court sentenced Dr. He to three years in prison for "illegal medical practice". 

As scientists elsewhere start to catch up with China's vast genetic research program, gene editing is fueling an innovation economy that threatens to widen racial and economic inequality. Fundamental questions about science, health, and social justice are at stake: Who gets access to gene editing technologies? As countries around the globe, from the US to Indonesia, loosen regulations, can we shape research agendas to promote an ethical and fair society? 

Eben Kirksey takes us on a groundbreaking journey to meet the key scientists, lobbyists, and entrepreneurs who are bringing cutting-edge genetic modification tools like CRISPR to your local clinic. He also ventures beyond the scientific echo chamber, talking to disabled scholars, doctors, hackers, chronically ill patients, and activists who have alternative visions of a future shaped by genetic engineering. 

The Mutant Project empowers us to ask the right questions, uncover the truth, and better prepare for this brave new world we're already entering.
