# ERN-LabArchives

Now we have Lab Archive, that is another place to make notes. This is the place where Rothamsted is supposed to put their notes. 
I must keep an open mind that the tool is going to be of help to the process, 

Recently, with that addition, and also now, how I see that this obsidian can be really useful?
maintaining a Work Obsidian and a ERN seems silly - but why not? 
if OBSIDIAN is my drafting place, how do I make it that it can be used for work and for home! 

Now for WORK> 

- Eventually. at the root of the journal, I would like to have a simple document that would describe the way I use this notebook, or my own workk workflow. journal generally, and then deep down where I put things. That is a personal idea because until I have formed a habit, I tend to forget what I do (but that is my personal issue) 
- Some projects will have their own notebook, so this needs to be something that can help me work, remember what I have done, may be before they go in the main project folder. I have found that OBSIDIAN is quite a good way to draft things. I need to experiment here with linking, connecting and finding stuff and see if this an adequate place to draft - or how that notebook 

Where is all the information coming from? many places: so there needs to be a simple workflow to ensure that the information that passes my eyes, ears, is properly captured, in a safe place 
info comes from 
- TEAMS Chat features
	- chats on teams conversations with separate people
	- chats on teams channels
	- 
- 

​  

What is important to me is that I do the work that I am given, that the creativity is reserved, that I know where I keep the info, that it is properly documented, that someone looking at my work will be able to understand how it works. 

My own problems - At time, I can be flooded with many ideas and thoughts. 

The document 2024 FJP is my forward job plan for this year and will also help locate things. 

I need a Reference folder to put all the documentations I need or links to them
