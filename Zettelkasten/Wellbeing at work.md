If you wish to discuss any issue, be it work, family, finances or any other matter, including stress, you may find it helpful to talk to a member of the Group.
- [The Mental Health First Aiders](https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Frothamsted.sharepoint.com%2Fsites%2FHealthSafety%2FSitePages%2FMental-Health-First-Aiders.aspx&data=05%7C01%7Cnathalie.castells%40rothamsted.ac.uk%7Cf0d7736374574b5372e308dbdab2ea86%7Cb688362589414342b0e37b8cc8392f64%7C0%7C0%7C638344234231104173%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=QFFXq1F%2BVdNa0QkwAo%2BN8HqNQzuc6BqX75epN%2F53y9k%3D&reserved=0) are staff members who have all completed Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) training, and are available if you need support with a mental health issue or are concerned about a colleague.

- [The Mental Wellbeing Page](https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Frothamsted.sharepoint.com%2Fsites%2FHealthSafety%2FSitePages%2FMental-Wellbeing(1).aspx&data=05%7C01%7Cnathalie.castells%40rothamsted.ac.uk%7Cf0d7736374574b5372e308dbdab2ea86%7Cb688362589414342b0e37b8cc8392f64%7C0%7C0%7C638344234231104173%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=dgHz1QVb7EF%2BgSlZHRZ0lhz%2FJEI9LlkcloINrSC7X1M%3D&reserved=0) is a repository of information on mental health, including stress mitigation articles and other external links and services. We try to keep this page frequently updated so it’s always worth a look if you or a colleague is going through a period of difficulty.

**Worry Anxiety and Stress Workshops** run throughout the year.  These are small (ten people or less) workshops that discuss these subjects to raise awareness, exchange information on coping and resilience strategies and are a safe space to discuss, in confidence, your own issues with colleagues attending to learn more, help others and understand their thoughts and feelings. Look out for announcements from the Safety Team who co-ordinate these workshops and can allocate you a space. Workshops have already run this year and more are planned for January and March 2024.

**Formal Stress Risk Assessment** may be helpful to you if you have tried other options and feel you wish to take a formal approach to stress identification and mitigation with a facilitator. This follows the HSE guidance and takes a methodical approach to assessing and identifying sources of stress, and finding positive actions to take in mitigating them in a more formal way. You may be referred after an event, a period of absence or refer yourself via [rres.safety@rothamsted.ac.uk](mailto:rres.safety@rothamsted.ac.uk).  This process is confidential, but we may need to consult others to achieve the best outcome possible (with your permission).

Today’s **Town Hall** will announce an important development and resource - an **Employee Assistance Scheme**. The Town Hall meeting will cover the details of what’s going to be available, but it will be a substantial addition to our Mental Health services.

**Social Clubs and Activities** are a great way to positively reinforce good mental health. Have a look at what’s available on the [Rothamsted Sports and Social Club Page](https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Frothamsted.sharepoint.com%2Fsites%2Frssc%2FSitePages%2FRothamsted-Sports-and-Social-Club.aspx%23clubs-calendar&data=05%7C01%7Cnathalie.castells%40rothamsted.ac.uk%7Cf0d7736374574b5372e308dbdab2ea86%7Cb688362589414342b0e37b8cc8392f64%7C0%7C0%7C638344234231104173%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=ET8J%2FbYUnWI%2FKG8CUQHxbYmOVM3VH5ZihHo0vpwP5Vs%3D&reserved=0)
