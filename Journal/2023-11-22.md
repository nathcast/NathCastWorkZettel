## FOR catch up meeting: 

- [x] Do we need to discuss the specific resource type choices: there can be only one of these (I have checked the schema) - there was a question that weather data could also be sorted as monthly, yearly - but here we have rain, temperature and so on - so it will be either on the type of data or the type of aggregation.

how about a table 

To create a table, create a single `|` character, then type the table's first  
heading and press Tab. Continue entering headings and pressing  
Tab until all the headings are created. Press Enter to  
go to the first row. Continue filling cells as before, and press  
Enter again for each new row.
