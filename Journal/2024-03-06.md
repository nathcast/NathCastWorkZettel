## Morning Purge: 

### How are you?

I am in a good space today. I arrived early as I dropped THOM to work 

I was listening to Jordan Peterson on my way to work. Don;t LIE> That is a good principle. 
There are many ways to lie: compromising with my own value is a lie. Truth: speaking my truth and not agreeing with another narrative will help progress toward the incarnation of  it. Walking in truth - comparing to knowing or hearing what is true. 
### Action Plan
