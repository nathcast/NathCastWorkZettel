Back from Holidays: 


Also, I am thinking of the workflow between: 
Draft notes in Obsidian or and inbox in the lab notebook
Then moving things to either the ELN, or GIT, or the cards. 

When I process emails, they are put in the deferred folder, so they wait there until action is done. 

- Helped Steve McGrath: find the shared files in his google drive: he is working on documents accross different organisations and they are sharing files using GOOGLE drive. I helped him with his browser, showing how to organise the bookmarks and also how to create new documents in google drive. He said some people might need courses. He made some comments on how to have a form of versioning in the documents and how to properly work on the same documents. 
- Updated the People with a lot of new names, and also updated organisations with help from Margaret. 
- Processed eRADOC file PS-WERE but this is still too faint: Margaret is going to make some PDFS because these files are unusable. 
- See Clockify for the rest of the day
