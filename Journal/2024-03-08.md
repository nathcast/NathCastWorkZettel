## The Day: 
Start at 1400 - aim to finish at 1700 I must remember that the logged time is action time!. But am I aiming for 100% action? Anything above 1600 is ok ! 

eracuration works but there is a small bug - to clean up later. 

I have made a new version of the code to the db2json, I need to install that on the machines of Sarah and Margaret or at least guide them through installation.
